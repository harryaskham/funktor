# funktor

## Things to do
- Need to have easy way to join SE and IO (maybe just use SE everywhere)
- Figure out ReaderT to avoid passing BPM around everywhere, or numBeats for a delayable.
- Where 4 is hardcoded we should be accessing State to get a time sig
- Notion of Verse (or implement Monoid for Song - needs song length though)
- Need a proper sequencer / trigger, UI / datatype for this to avoid need to line up delays and durations.
- Segment / Note / Scale etc transposition
- Instrument mashups / FX to avoid stock instrument syndrome
- Segments fading in and out instead of cutoffs
- Do some stuff with envelope mashups for an extra layer of progressive dropout
