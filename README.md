## Things to do
- Figure out ReaderT to avoid passing BPM around everywhere, or numBeats for a delayable.
- Randomised beat generation in tab-space
- More procedural Melody generator within a given scale-space
- Humanizer that can cause drop-out in Tab-space or Melody-space (replace with silence for example)
