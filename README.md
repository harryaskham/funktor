# funktor

## Things to do
- Need to have easy way to join SE and IO (maybe just use SE everywhere)
- Figure out ReaderT to avoid passing BPM around everywhere, or numBeats for a delayable.
- Proper ordering on notes so we can get transposition
- Where 4 is hardcoded we should be accessing State to get a time sig
- Notion of Verse (or implement Monoid for Song - needs song length)
- Key changes
